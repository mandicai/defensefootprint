  <meta name="description" content="Where is the US military? For most civilians, it can be very difficult to wrap our minds around everything the US military does around the world. The military doesn’t just wage war; from advise and assist to humanitarian aid and everything in between, our American troops are engaged in missions in almost every nation worldwide. Defense Footprint’s mission is to educate the public on the U.S.’s global military presence by visualizing the factors contributing to its “defense footprint.">

      <h3>About</h3>
      <h4>Our mission</h4>
      <div class="about-container">
        <p><span class="about-name">Defense Footprint</span> is a non-partisan project that promotes a stronger public understanding of the US military. We are neither watchdog activists nor a pro-military group; instead, we present relevant statistics in an accessible way. We believe that Americans should be informed about what their largest public institution does—as a civilian-led military, the US military is the responsibility of the American people. We call this need to be informed “defense literacy.” Because statistics on the military’s activities differ depending on the data source, our approach is to offer these different sources side-by-side and let people form their own opinions. We hope that increasing defense literacy will empower ordinary Americans to take informed stances on military issues—be they hawkish or dovish, liberal or conservative—and to constructively debate them in the public sphere.</p>
