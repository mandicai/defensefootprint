  <title>Defense Footprint</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Where is the US military? For most civilians, it can be very difficult to wrap our minds around everything the US military does around the world. The military doesn’t just wage war; from advise and assist to humanitarian aid and everything in between, our American troops are engaged in missions in almost every nation worldwide. Defense Footprint’s mission is to educate the public on the U.S.’s global military presence by visualizing the factors contributing to its “defense footprint.">

      <h4>Our mission is twofold.</h4>
      <div class="about-container">
        <ul>
          <li> 
            Provide plain speak/nonpartisan educational materials for the public, because the US military’s activities are vast and
            varied. It is very daunting for the uninitiated to get a comprehensive understanding of what the US military is doing
            overseas, and we want to provide a comprehensive resource for the public to that end.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide comprehensive, regularly updated, and easily accessible datasets for researchers to use.
