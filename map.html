        <h2> How did we quantify conflict? </h2>
        <p>
          War is a state of armed conflict between states or societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called "peace". Warfare refers to the
          common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.[1] Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties.
          While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature,[2] others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.[3] The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths
          since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests[4] at up to 60 million. As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern
          history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties). In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990.[5] In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth (of ten) biggest problem facing humanity
          for the next fifty years.[6] War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war
          or civilians.[7][8][9] For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1.6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war,
          500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians).[10] Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict,[11] and increased revenues by
          weapons manufacturers.[12]

        <h2> Context and Terminology </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>What is war?</b><br> Conventionally, war is defined as “open and declared conflict between the armed forces of two or more nations or parties.” However, the US Military’s overseas engagements encompass more than just war, and their adversaries
          are not just other nations.
          <br>
          <br> Other types of US military activities include:
          <br>
          <br>Advise and assist
          <br>Rescue operations
          <br>Medical assistance relief
          <br>Food and humanitarian relief
          <br>Embassy security
          <br>Policing in volatile areas
          <br>Natural disaster relief
          <br>Law enforcement
          <br>Piracy and drug interdiction
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Who can declare war?</b><br> The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the sole power to declare war and to “raise and support” an army. As commander and chief, the president can unilaterally order military action, but the War Powers Resolution
          of 1973 limits the length of that action and requires that the president inform Congress within 48 hours. It also gives Congress a veto mechanism that allows them to recall US troops at any time.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Components of the US Military</b>

          <br>Reserves
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Declaration of War</b>- <i>formal act by Congress that officially declares a war between the US and another entity</i>
          <br>
          <b>Combat Mission</b>- <i>armed fighting with enemy forces in a mission to combat or defend something</i>
          <br>
          <b>Security Force Assistance Operations</b>- <i>Advise and Assist Mission; action to generate, employ, and sustain local, host nation, or regional security forces in support of a legitimate authority</i>
          <br>
          <b>Casualty</b>- <i>a person (either civilian or military member) killed in military action; or, a military member captured, deserted, missing, disabled by injuries, disabled by psychological trauma, or killed by disease.</i>
          <br>
          <b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</b>- <i>an aircraft piloted by remote control or onboard computers; a drone</i>
          <br>
          <b>Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems</b>- <i>an entire drone system, including: the aircraft, the control station that operates the aircraft, and the wireless data link</i>
